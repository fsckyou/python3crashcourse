# 1. Variables

## Summary
Ok so now you can do simple calculations in Python, but what if you want to store and recall information? Well....

## What is a Variable?
A variable is used to store information that can be referenced later

## Declaring a Python Variable
Try this:
```
>>> result
```
What happens?

What you see is how Python shows you an error. The error in this case is that the variable "result" hasn't been declared. You _declare_ a variable by assigning a value to a name. Like this:
```
>>> result = 3 * 5
>>> result
15
```
### Variable Naming Rules
Can I name a variable `Steve`? `fr3d`? `123`? `1var`? `_hi_`?
