# 8. Comments

## Summary
Comments allow you to annotate your code without running the annotations themselves!

## What is a Python comment?
Let’s start by defining what a comment is exactly:

### Comment
A comment is an explanation in the source code of a Python program. Comments are added with the purpose of making source code easier for humans to understand. They are ignored by the Python interpreter.

So, in short, a comment helps you and other readers of your code to better understand it.

## A single-line Python comment
In Python, we create a comment by starting the line with the hash symbol: #. This symbol is known as the number sign, hash, or (in North American usage) pound sign. Whatever you call it, this is what it looks like:
```py 
# This is a single-line comment in Python
print('Hello')
# And here's another one!
```
## Multiline Python comment
There’s no special way to add multi-line comments, also called block comments. Instead, you simply use the hash symbol at the start of each line, like so:
```py
# This is a multi-line comment in Python,
# there's not much difference with single-
# line comments, as you can see!
```
In Python (or any language, for that matter), it’s better to write clear, understandable code. So if you’re doing well, you should not need multi-line comments that often!
